zoomableDecimal
===============

A number line in processing which will allow user to zoom in using a pinch-out and zoom back using pinch multi-touch methods.

TO DO
==========

1.) Add panning
2.) Rendring needs to happen as scaling reaches certain level (in SMT library scale() method returns only void)
3.) Add recursive drawing
4.) Add + and - buttons for zooming in and out too
